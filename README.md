## 2024 Update

Not much has changed in the past 3 years and I was never successful at making progress. I still own xasix.com and my email is still howard@xasix.com. I am currently hosting it on a VPS with root access running Ubuntu 24.04 with Apache.

I am using builderxd.com (also mine) to integrate Crossmint.com API's into a user interface to create a platform for construction bid and ask as well as buy/sell/trade marketplace using web2 and crossmint as a gateway to web3.

I'm still learning and a beginner. Whenever I talk to developers they ask if I am doing De-Fi and I honestly don't know. I think my current approach is a www web app but am open to using a decentralized infrastructure if I can understand how to and the benefits for my use case.

Follow me! I am trying to NOT GIVE UP lol
